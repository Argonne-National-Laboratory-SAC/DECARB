"a The GWP values presented here from the AR5 report include climate-carbon feedbacks for the non-CO2 gases in order to be consistent with the approach used in calculating the CO2 lifetime. Additionally, for methane the AR5 reported separate values for fossil versus biogenic methane in order to account for the CO2 oxidation product and that is not shown on this table.
