"Notes: Increases to CH4 and N2O emissions from mobile combustion relative to previous Inventories are largely due to updates made to the Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES2014b) model that is used to estimate on-road gasoline vehicle distribution and mileage across the time series, as well as non-transportation mobile fuel consumption. See Section 3.1 “CH4 and N2O from Mobile Combustion” for more detail. This year’s Inventory uses the NONROAD component of MOVES2014b for years 1999 through 2019. In 2016, historical confidential vehicle sales data were re-evaluated to determine the engine technology assignments. First, several light-duty trucks were re-characterized as heavy-duty vehicles based upon gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and confidential sales data. Second, the emission standards each vehicle type was assumed to have met were re-examined using confidential sales data. Also, in previous Inventories, non-plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) were considered alternative fueled vehicles and therefore not included in the engine technology breakouts. For this Inventory, HEVs are classified as gasoline vehicles across the entire time series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"b Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle fuel consumption estimates used to develop CO2 estimates in this Inventory are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table MF-21, MF-27 and VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2019). Data from Table VM-1 are used to estimate the share of fuel consumption between each on-road vehicle class. For mobile CH4 and N2O emissions estimates, gasoline and diesel highway vehicle mileage estimates are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2019). These fuel consumption and mileage estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2018). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c  In 2017, estimates of alternative fuel vehicle mileage for the last ten years were revised to reflect updates made to EIA data on alternative fuel use and vehicle counts. These changes were incorporated into this year’s Inventory and apply to the 2005 to 2019 time period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"g  Other emissions from electricity generation are a result of waste incineration (as the majority of municipal solid waste is combusted in “trash-to-steam” electricity generation plants), electrical transmission and distribution, and a portion of Other Process Uses of Carbonates (from pollution control equipment installed in electricity generation plants).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
