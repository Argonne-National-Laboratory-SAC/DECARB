"c Prior to 2001, gasoline and diesel fuel totals were estimated using data provided by the Military Services for 1990 and 1996. The 1991 through 1995 data points were interpolated from the Service inventory data. The 1997 through 1999 gasoline and diesel fuel data were initially extrapolated from the 1996 inventory data. Growth factors used for other diesel and gasoline were 5.2 and -21.1 percent, respectively. However, prior diesel fuel estimates from 1997 through 2000 were reduced according to the estimated consumption of jet fuel that is assumed to have replaced the diesel fuel consumption in land-based vehicles. Datasets for other diesel and gasoline consumed by the military in 2000 were estimated based on ground fuels consumption trends. This method produced a result that was more consistent with expected consumption for 2000. Since 2001, other gasoline and diesel fuel totals were generated by DLA Energy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d The fraction of jet fuel consumed in land-based vehicles was estimated based on DLA Energy data as well as Military Service and expert judgment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
