1 Transitions between the start year and date of full penetration in new equipment are assumed to be linear so that in total 100 percent of the market is assigned to the original ODS or the various ODS substitutes.,,,,,,,,,
"2 Despite the 1994 consumption ban, a small percentage of new halon systems are assumed to continue to be built and filled with stockpiled or recovered supplies.",,,,,,,,,
3 Growth Rate is the average annual growth rate for individual market sectors from the base year to 2030.,,,,,,,,,
