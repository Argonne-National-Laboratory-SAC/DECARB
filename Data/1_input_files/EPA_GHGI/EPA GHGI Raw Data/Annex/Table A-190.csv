"Note: For most activity sources data were not available after 2015 and emissions were estimated with a data splicing method. Additional activity data will be collected and the Tier 1, 2 and 3 methods will be applied in a future inventory to recalculate the part of the time series that is estimated with the data splicing methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"b Includes dried blood, tankage, compost, other. Excludes dried manure and bio-solids (i.e., treated sewage sludge) used as commercial fertilizer to avoid double counting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c Annual Implied Emission Factor (kt N2O-N/kt N) is calculated by dividing total estimated emissions by total activity data for N applied.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
