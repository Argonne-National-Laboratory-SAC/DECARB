Notes: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Parentheses indicate net sequestration. Total emissions (excluding emissions for which uncertainty was not quantified) are presented without LULUCF. Net emissions are presented with LULUCF.,,,,
+ Does not exceed 0.05 MMT CO2 Eq. or 0.5 percent.,,,,
NE (Not Estimated),,,,
a Base Year is 1990 for all sources.,,,,
"b The uncertainty estimates correspond to a 95 percent confidence interval, with the lower bound corresponding to 2.5th percentile and the upper bound corresponding to 97.5th percentile.",,,,
c Emissions from Wood Biomass and Biofuel Consumption are not included in the energy sector totals.,,,,
d Emissions from International Bunker Fuels are not included in the totals.,,,,
"e This source category’s estimate for 2019 excludes 0.029 MMT CO2 Eq. of HTF emissions included in electronics totals from photovoltaic manufacturing, as uncertainties associated with those sources were not assessed. Hence, for this source category, the emissions reported in this table do not match the emission estimates presented in the Industrial Processes and Product Use chapter of the Inventory.",,,,
f Totals exclude emissions for which uncertainty was not quantified.,,,,
"g LULUCF emissions include the CH4 and N2O emissions reported for Peatlands Remaining Peatlands, Forest Fires, Drained Organic Soils, Grassland Fires, and Coastal Wetlands Remaining Coastal Wetlands; CH4 emissions from Land Converted to Coastal Wetlands; and N2O emissions from Forest Soils and Settlement Soils.",,,,
"h LULUCF Carbon Stock Change is the net C stock change from the following categories: Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, Land Converted to Forest Land, Cropland Remaining Cropland, Land Converted to Cropland, Grassland Remaining Grassland, Land Converted to Grassland, Wetlands Remaining Wetlands, Land Converted to Wetlands, Settlements Remaining Settlements, and Land Converted to Settlements. Since the resulting flux is negative the signs of the resulting lower and upper bounds are reversed.",,,,
i The LULUCF Sector Net Total is the net sum of all CH4 and N2O emissions to the atmosphere plus net carbon stock changes.,,,,
