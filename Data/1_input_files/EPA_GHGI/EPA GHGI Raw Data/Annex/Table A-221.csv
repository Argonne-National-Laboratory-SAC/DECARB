"a This estimate represents the waste that has been in place for 30 years or less, which contributes about 90 percent of the CH4 generation. Values are based on EPA (1993) for years 1940 to years 1988 (not presented in table), BioCycle 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2010 for years 1989 to 2009 (1981 to 2004, and 2006 to 2011 are not presented in table). Values for years 2010 to 2019 are based on EREF (2016) and annual population data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2020).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b This estimate is the cumulative amount of waste that has been placed in landfills for the 30 years prior to the year indicated and is the sum of the annual disposal rates used in the first order decay model. Values are based on EPA 1993; BioCycle 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2010; EREF 2016; and extrapolated data based on annual population increases (U.S. Census Bureau 2020).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c This estimate represents the cumulative amount of waste that has been placed in landfills since 1940 to the year indicated and is the sum of the annual disposal rates used in the first order decay model. Values are based on EPA 1993; BioCycle 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2010; EREF 2016; and extrapolated data based on annual population increases (U.S. Census Bureau 2020).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d A disposal factor of 0.050 MT/MT of product is applied to total pulp and paper production data to estimate the annual amount landfilled. See Step 7 for the references and rationale for this method. The same disposal factor is applied to every year of the time series. Production data from 1990 and 2001 are from Lockwood-Post's Directory, 2002. Production data from 2002 to 2019 are from the FAOStat database available at: http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html#DOWNLOAD. Accessed on May 20, 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e A disposal factor of 0.046 MT/MT of product is applied to total food production data to estimate the annual amount landfilled. See Step 7 for the references and rationale for this method. The same disposal factor is applied to every year of the time series. Food production values for 1990 to 2019 are from ERG 2020. 2020 USDA-NASS Ag QuickStats available at http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov (FAO 2019). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
