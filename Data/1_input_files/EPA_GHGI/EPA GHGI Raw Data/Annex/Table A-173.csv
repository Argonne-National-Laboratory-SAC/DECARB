Manure Management System,Description a
"Pasture, Range, Paddock","The manure from pasture and range grazing animals is allowed to lie as is and is not managed. Methane emissions are accounted for under Manure Management, but the N2O emissions from manure deposited on PRP are included under the Agricultural Soil Management category."
Daily Spread,Manure is routinely removed from a confinement facility and is applied to cropland or pasture within 24 hours of excretion. Methane and indirect N2O emissions are accounted for under Manure Management. Direct N2O emissions from land application are covered under the Agricultural Soil Management category. 
Solid Storage,"The storage of manure, typically for a period of several months, in unconfined piles or stacks. Manure is able to be stacked due to the presence of a sufficient amount of bedding material or loss of moisture by evaporation. "
Dry Lot,A paved or unpaved open confinement area without any significant vegetative cover where accumulating manure may be removed periodically. Dry lots are most typically found in dry climates but also are used in humid climates. 
Liquid/ Slurry,"Manure is stored as excreted or with some minimal addition of water to facilitate handling and is stored in either tanks or earthen ponds, usually for periods less than one year. "
Anaerobic Lagoon,"Uncovered anaerobic lagoons are designed and operated to combine waste stabilization and storage. Lagoon supernatant is usually used to remove manure from the associated confinement facilities to the lagoon. Anaerobic lagoons are designed with varying lengths of storage (up to a year or greater), depending on the climate region, the VS loading rate, and other operational factors. Anaerobic lagoons accumulate sludge over time, diminishing treatment capacity. Lagoons must be cleaned out once every 5 to 15 years, and the sludge is typically applied to agricultural lands. The water from the lagoon may be recycled as flush water or used to irrigate and fertilize fields. Lagoons are sometimes used in combination with a solids separator, typically for dairy waste. Solids separators help control the buildup of nondegradable material such as straw or other bedding materials. "
Anaerobic Digester,"Animal excreta with or without straw are collected and anaerobically digested in a large containment vessel (complete mix or plug flow digester) or covered lagoon. Digesters are designed and operated for waste stabilization by the microbial reduction of complex organic compounds to CO2 and CH4, which is captured and flared or used as a fuel."
Deep Pit,"Collection and storage of manure usually with little or no added water typically below a slatted floor in an enclosed animal confinement facility. Typical storage periods range from 5 to 12 months, after which manure is removed from the pit and transferred to a treatment system or applied to land."
Poultry with Litter,"Enclosed poultry houses use bedding derived from wood shavings, rice hulls, chopped straw, peanut hulls, or other products, depending on availability. The bedding absorbs moisture and dilutes the manure produced by the birds. Litter is typically cleaned out completely once a year. These manure systems are typically used for all poultry breeder flocks and for the production of meat type chickens (broilers) and other fowl."
Poultry without Litter,"In high-rise cages or scrape-out/belt systems, manure is excreted onto the floor below with no bedding to absorb moisture. The ventilation system dries the manure as it is stored. When designed and operated properly, this high-rise system is a form of passive windrow composting."
"a Manure management system descriptions and the classification of manure as managed or unmanaged are based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use, Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management, Tables 10.18 and 10.21) and the Development Document for the Final Revisions to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Regulation and the Effluent Guidelines for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (EPA-821-R-03-001, December 2002).",
