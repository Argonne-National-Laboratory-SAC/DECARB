"a The GWP values presented here are the ones most consistent with the methodology used in the AR4 report. The AR5 report has also calculated GWP values (shown in Table A-240) where climate-carbon feedbacks have been included for the non-CO2 gases in order to be consistent with the approach used in calculating the CO2 lifetime.  Additionally, for methane the AR5 reported separate values for fossil versus biogenic methane in order to account for the CO2 oxidation product and that is not shown on this table. See footnotes to Table A-238.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
