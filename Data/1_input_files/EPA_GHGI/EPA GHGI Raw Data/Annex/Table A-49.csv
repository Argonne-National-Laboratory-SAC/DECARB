a Includes processes for which specific coking coal consumption and emission factor data are not available. Consumption of coking coal for production of iron and steel is covered in the Industrial Processes and Product Use chapter.,
"b The storage factor listed is the value for 2019. As described in this annex, the factor varies over time.",
"c Assumes petroleum coke consumption is for pigments. Consumption of petroleum coke for production of primary aluminum anodes, electric arc furnace anodes, titanium dioxide, ammonia, urea, and ferroalloys is covered in the Industrial Processes and Product Use chapter. ",
d The miscellaneous products category reported by EIA is assumed to be mostly petroleum refinery sulfur compounds that do not contain carbon (EIA 2019). ,
