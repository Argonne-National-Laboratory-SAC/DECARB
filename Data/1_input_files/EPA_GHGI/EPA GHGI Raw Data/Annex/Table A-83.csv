Note: Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle mileage are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2019). These mileage consumption estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2018).,,,
"a  Heavy-Duty Vehicles includes Medium-Duty Trucks, Heavy-Duty Trucks, and Buses.",,,
"b In 2011, FHWA changed its methodology for Table VM-1, which impacts estimates for the 2007 to 2019 time period. These methodological changes include how on-road vehicles are classified, moving from a system based on body-type to one that is based on wheelbase. This resulted in large changes in VMT data by vehicle class between 2006 and 2007. ",,,
