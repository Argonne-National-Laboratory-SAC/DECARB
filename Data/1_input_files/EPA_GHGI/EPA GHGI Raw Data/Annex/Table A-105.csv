"Notes: Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle fuel consumption estimates used to develop CO2 estimates in this Inventory are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table MF-21, MF-27 and VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2019). Data from Table VM-1 is used to estimate the share of fuel consumption between each on-road vehicle class. For mobile CH4 and N2O emissions estimates, gasoline and diesel highway vehicle mileage estimates are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2019). These fuel consumption and mileage estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2018).

"In 2016, historical confidential vehicle sales data was re-evaluated to determine the engine technology assignments. First several light-duty trucks were re-characterized as heavy-duty vehicles based upon gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and confidential sales data. Second, the emission standards each vehicle type was assumed to have met were re-examined using confidential sales data. Also, in previous Inventories, non-plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) were considered alternative fueled vehicles and therefore not included in the engine technology breakouts. For this Inventory, HEVs are classified as gasoline vehicles across the entire time series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NA (Not Applicable), as there were no HFC emissions allocated to the transport sector in 1990, and thus a growth rate cannot be calculated. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a The method used to estimate CO2 emissions from non-transportation mobile sources in this supplementary information table differs from the method used to estimate CO2 in the industrial and commercial sectors in the Inventory, which include CO2 emissions from all non-transportation mobile sources (see Section 3.1 for the methodology for estimating CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in this Inventory).
