"Note: Because these compounds have been shown to deplete stratospheric ozone, they are typically referred to as ODSs. However, they are also potent greenhouse gases. Recognizing the harmful effects of these compounds on the ozone layer, in 1987 many governments signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to limit the production and importation of a number of CFCs and other halogenated compounds. The United States furthered its commitment to phase-out ODSs by signing and ratifying the Copenhagen Amendments to the Montreal Protocol in 1992. Under these amendments, the United States committed to ending the production and importation of halons by 1994, and CFCs by 1996, and HCFCs by 2030. ",
