Notes: MSW and Industrial CH4 generation in Table A-228 represents emissions before oxidation. Totals may not sum exactly to the last significant figure due to rounding. Parentheses denote negative values. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“-“ Not applicable due to methodology change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a MSW Net CH4 emissions for years 2010 to 2019 are directly reported CH4 emissions to the EPA’s GHGRP for MSW landfills and are back-casted to estimate emissions for 2005 to 2009. A scale-up factor of 9 percent of each year’s emissions from 2005 to 2016, and a scale-up factor of 11 percent of each year’s emissions from 2016 to 2019 is applied to account for landfills that do not report annual methane emissions to the GHGRP. Emissions for years 1990 to 2004 are calculated by the FOD methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
