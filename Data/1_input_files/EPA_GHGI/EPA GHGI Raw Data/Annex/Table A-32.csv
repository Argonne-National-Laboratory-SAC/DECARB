a C contents vary annually based on changes in annual mix of production and end-use consumption of coal from each producing state. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b EIA discontinued collection of residential sector coal consumption data in 2008, because consumption of coal in the residential sector is extremely limited. Therefore, starting in 2008, the number cited here is developed from commercial/institutional consumption. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Content for utility coal used in the electric power calculations. All coefficients based on higher heating value. Higher heating value (gross heating value) is the total amount of heat released when a fuel is burned. Coal, crude oil, and natural gas all include chemical compounds of carbon and hydrogen. When those fuels are burned, the carbon and hydrogen combine with oxygen in the air to produce CO2 and water. Some of the energy released in burning goes into transforming the water into steam and is usually lost. The amount of heat spent in transforming the water into steam is counted as part of gross heat content. Lower heating value (net heating value), in contrast, does not include the heat spent in transforming the water into steam. Using a simplified methodology based on International Energy Agency defaults, higher heating value can be converted to lower heating value for coal and petroleum products by multiplying by 0.95 and for natural gas by multiplying by 0.90. Carbon content coefficients are presented in higher heating value because U.S. energy statistics are reported by higher heating value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d C contents vary annually based on changes in fuel composition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e The miscellaneous products category reported by EIA is assumed to be mostly petroleum refinery sulfur compounds that do not contain carbon (EIA 2019).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f C contents based on geotype (i.e., flash steam and dry steam) were obtained from EPA’s Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) 2018 Technical Support Document (EPA 2020a). C contents were obtained in pounds CO2/megawatt hour and were applied to net generation by geotype (in megawatt hours) from EIA (2020a). C contents were converted to MMT Carbon/QBtu in this table. C contents for binary and binary/flash geotypes are zero and have been excluded from this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
