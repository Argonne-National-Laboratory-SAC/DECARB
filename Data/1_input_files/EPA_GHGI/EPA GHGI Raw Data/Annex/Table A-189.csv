Table A-189:  Rate and standard deviation for the Initial Increase and Subsequent Annual Mass Accumulation Rate (Mg C/ha-yr) in Soil Organic C Following Wetland Restoration of Conservation Reserve Program,
Variable,Value
Factor (Initial Increase—First 10 Years),1.22±0.18
Mass Accumulation (After Initial 10 Years),0.79±0.05
Note: Mass accumulation rate represents additional gains in C for mineral soils after the first 10 years (Euliss and Gleason 2002). ,
