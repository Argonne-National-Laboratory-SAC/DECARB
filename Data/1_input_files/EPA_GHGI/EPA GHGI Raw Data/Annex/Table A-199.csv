Note: Estimates after 2015 are based on a data splicing method (See the Agricultural Soil Management section for more information). The Tier 1 and 3 methods will be applied in a future inventory to recalculate the part of the time series that is estimated with the data splicing methods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
