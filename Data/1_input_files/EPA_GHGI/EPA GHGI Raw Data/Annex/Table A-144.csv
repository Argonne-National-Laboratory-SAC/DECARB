"Note: The cohort starting at age 7 months on January 1 is tracked in order to illustrate how a single cohort moves through the transition matrix. Each month, the cohort reflects the decreases in population due to the estimated 0.35 percent annual death loss and loss due to placement in feedlots (the latter resulting in the majority of the loss from the matrix).",,,,,,,,,,,,
