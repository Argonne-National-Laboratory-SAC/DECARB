1.A Fossil Fuel Combustion,,,,
1.A.3 Transport,,,,
1.A.3.a,Domestic Aviation-Biomass,N2O,"Prior to 2011, no biobased jet fuel was assumed to be used for domestic aviation. Between 2011 and 2015, 22 airlines performed over 2,500 commercial passenger flights with blends of up to 50 percent biojet fuel. Furthermore, several airlines have concluded long-term offtake agreements with biofuel suppliers.[1] An analysis was conducted based on the total annual volumes of fuels specified in the long-term agreements. Emissions of N2O were estimated based on the factors for jet fuel combustion. As for jet fuel use in commercial aircraft, contributions of methane (CH4) emissions are reported as zero. ",16
1.A.3.b.iv,Motorcycles-Biomass,CH4 and N2O,"Emissions from ethanol mixed with gasoline in low blends are included in the on-road gasoline emissions for motorcycles.   If there is any use of high blend ethanol fuel in motorcycles, it is considered insignificant.  The percent of VMT from high ethanol blends in light duty gas vehicles (flex fuel vehicles) is less than 1 percent.  If the same percentage is applied to motorcycle VMT with assumed flex fuel CH4 and N2O emission factors, it results in estimated emissions of 0.0015 kt CO2 Eq. ",0.0015
1.A.3.c,Railways-Biomass,CH4 and N2O,There are no readily available data sources to estimate the use of biofuel in railways. Railways represent about 6 percent of all diesel fuel use. An assumption can be made that railways consume that same percentage of biofuels (6 percent of all biodiesel). Based on that assumption for biofuel use and applying fossil fuel CH4 and N2O factors results in estimated emissions of 12.9 kt CO2 Eq. per year.,12.9
1.A.3.d,Domestic Navigation-Biomass,CH4 and N2O,There are no readily available data sources to estimate the use of biofuel in domestic navigation. Domestic navigation represents about 3 percent of all diesel fuel use and about 1 percent of all gasoline fuel use. An assumption can be made that domestic navigation consumes that same percentage of biofuels (3 percent of all biodiesel and 1 percent of all ethanol use). Based on that assumption for biofuel use and applying fossil fuel CH4 and N2O factors results in estimated emissions of 39.0 kt CO2 Eq. per year.,39
1.A.3.d,Domestic Navigation—Gaseous Fuels,CO2,Emissions from gaseous fuel use in domestic navigation are not currently estimated. Gaseous fuels are used in liquid natural gas (LNG) tankers and are being demonstrated in a small number of other ships. Data are not available to characterize these uses currently. ,NE
1.A.3.e Other Transportation,,,,
1.A.3.e.i,Pipeline Transport—Liquid Fuels,"CO2, CH4 and N2O","Use of liquid fuels to power pipeline pumps is uncommon, but has occurred. Data for fuel used in various activities including pipelines are based on survey data conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Association (EIA). From January 1983 through December 2009, EIA Survey data included information on liquid fuel used to power pipelines reported in terms of crude oil product supplied. Reporting of crude oil used for this purpose was discontinued after December 2009. Beginning with data for January 2010, product supplied for pipeline fuel is assumed to equal zero. 1997 was the last year of data reported on pipeline fuel. Taking the data reported for 1997 of 797,000 barrels of crude oil and using conversion factors of 5.8 MMBtu/bbl and 20.21 MMT C/Qbtu results in estimated emissions of 342.6 kt CO2. ",342.6
1.A.3.e.i,Pipeline Transport—Gaseous Fuels,"CO2, CH4 and N2O","CO2 emissions from gaseous fuels used as pipeline transport fuel are estimated in the Inventory, however CH4 and N2O emissions from gaseous pipeline fuel use have not been estimated. The CO2 / non-CO2 emissions split for other natural gas combustion can be used to estimate emissions. Based on that analysis, non-CO2 emissions represent approximately 0.43 percent of CO2 emissions from all natural gas combustion. If that percentage is applied to CO2 emissions from natural gas use as pipeline fuel, it results in an emissions estimate of 179.6 kt CO2 Eq. in 2017. ",179.6
1.A.3.e.ii,Non-Transportation Mobile-Biomass,CH4 and N2O,There are no readily available data sources to estimate the use of biofuel in non-transportation mobile sources. These sources represent about 21 percent of all diesel fuel use and about 4 percent of all gasoline fuel use. An assumption can be made that these sources consume that same percentage of biofuels (21 percent of all biodiesel and 4 percent of all ethanol use). Based on that assumption for biofuel use and applying fossil fuel CH4 and N2O factors results in estimated emissions of 256.4 kt CO2 Eq. per year.,256.4
1.A.5.a Other Stationary,,,,
1.A.5.a,Incineration of Waste: Medical Waste Incineration,CO2,"The category 1.A.5.a Other Stationary sources not specified elsewhere includes emissions from waste incineration of the municipal waste stream and waste tires. The category also includes emissions from non-energy uses of fuels which includes an energy recovery component that includes emissions from waste gas, waste oils, tars, and related materials from the industrial sector. While this is not a comprehensive inclusion of hazardous industrial waste, it does capture a subset. ",333
,,,"A portion of hazardous industrial waste not captured is from medical waste. However, a conservative analysis was conducted based on a study of hospital/medical/infectious waste incinerator (HMIWI) facilities in the United States[2] showing that medical waste incineration emissions could be considered insignificant. The analysis was based on assuming the total amount of annual waste throughput was of fossil origin and an assumption of 68.9 percent carbon composition of the waste. It was determined that annual greenhouse gas emissions for medical waste incineration are approximately 333 kt CO2 Eq. per year. ",
1.A.5.a,Stationary Fuel Combustion: Biomass in U.S. Territories,CH4 and N2O ,"Data are not available to estimate emissions from biomass in U.S. Territories. However, biomass consumption is likely small in comparison with other fuel types. An estimate of non-CO2 emissions from biomass fuels used in Territories can be made based on assuming the same ratio of domestic biomass non-CO2 emissions to fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Non-Territories data indicate that biomass non-CO2 emissions represents 0.2 percent of fossil fuel combustion CO2 emissions. Applying this same percentage to proxy U.S. Territories fossil fuel combustion CO2 emissions results in estimated emissions of 74.8 kt CO2 Eq. from biomass in U.S. Territories.",74.8
1.B Fugitive Emissions from Fuels,,,,
1.B.1 – Solid Fuels,,,,
"1.B.1.a.1.i, ",Fugitive Emissions from Underground Coal Mining Activities and Post-Mining Activities,CO2,A preliminary analysis by EPA determined that CO2 emissions for active underground coal mining activities are negligible. The analysis was based on gas composition data from three active underground mines in three different states.[3] An average ratio of CO2 to CH4 composition in mine gas was derived for active underground mines. This ratio was applied as a percentage (0.4 percent) to CH4 emission estimates to derive an estimate of CO2 emissions for active underground mines (including post-mining activities). Applying a CO2 emission rate as a percentage of CH4 emissions for active coal mines results in a national emission estimate of 177 kt CO2 Eq. per year. EPA anticipates including estimates for fugitive CO2 emissions from active underground coal mining in the next Inventory based on methods in the IPCC 2019 Refinement (see Planned Improvements in Chapter 3).,177
1.B.1.a.1.ii,,,,
1.B.1.a.1.iii,Fugitive Emissions from Abandoned Underground Coal Mines,CO2,"A preliminary analysis by EPA determined that CO2 emissions for abandoned underground coal mining activities are negligible. The analysis was based on gas composition data from two abandoned underground mines in two different states.[4] An average ratio of CO2 to CH4 composition in mine gas was derived for abandoned mines. This ratio was applied as a percentage (1.5 percent) to CH4 emission estimates to derive an estimate of CO2 emissions for abandoned mines. Applying a CO2 emission rate as a percentage of CH4 emissions for abandoned coal mines results in a national emission estimate below 93 kt CO2 Eq. per year. Future inventories may quantify these emissions, if it is deemed it will not require a disproportionate amount of effort. ",93
1.B.1.a.2,Fugitive Emissions from Surface Coal Mining Activities and Post-Mining Activities,CO2 ,"A preliminary analysis by EPA determined that CO2 emissions for active surface coal mining activities are negligible. The analysis was based on gas composition data from three active underground mines in three different states.[5] An average ratio of CO2 to CH4 composition in mine gas was derived for surface mines (including post-mining activities). This estimate for CO2 is considered conservative, as surface mining fugitive emissions of CH4 are significantly lower than those from underground coal mines. This ratio was applied as a percentage (0.4 percent) to CH4 emission estimates to derive an estimate of CO2 emissions for surface mines (including post-mining activities). Applying a CO2 emission rate as a percentage of CH4 emissions for surface coal mines results in a national emission estimate of 34 kt CO2 Eq. per year. EPA anticipates including estimates for fugitive CO2 emissions from active surface coal mining in the next inventory based on methods in the IPCC 2019 Refinement (see Planned Improvements in section 3).",34

2.B.4.b,Glyoxal Production,CO2 and N2O,"Glyoxal production data are not readily available to apply Tier 1 methods and estimate emissions from this source. EPA continues to conduct basic outreach to relevant trade associations and review potential databases that can be purchased and contain the necessary data. Outreach this year did not identify potential data sources. Any further progress on outreach will be included in next (i.e., 1990 through 2020) Inventory report. ",NE
2.B.4.c,Glyoxylic Acid Production,CO2 and N2O,"Data on national glyoxylic acid production data are currently not available to estimate emissions from this source using IPCC methods and then assess significance. EPA is conducting basic outreach to relevant trade associations reviewing potential databases that can be purchased and contain the necessary data. Outreach this year did not identify potential data sources. Any further progress on outreach will be included in next (i.e., 1990 through 2020) Inventory report. ",NE
2.B.5.b,Calcium Carbide,CH4,"Data are not currently available to estimate CH4 emissions from this source. It is difficult to obtain production data from trade associations and trade publications. This information is not collected by USGS, the agency that collects information on silicon carbide. EPA has initiated some research to obtain data from the limited production facilities in the United States (less than 5). In addition, during the Expert Review process for compilation of the current Inventory, EPA sought expert solicitation on production data for this source, but has yet to identify data sources to apply Tier 1 methods to proxy emissions and assess significance. Carbon dioxide emissions from calcium carbide are implicitly accounted for in the storage factor calculation for the non-energy use of petroleum coke in the Energy chapter.",NE
2.B.8.d,Petrochemical and Carbon Black Production,CO2 recovery,"EPA’s GHGRP has data starting in reporting year 2010 on the amount of CO2 captured, including at petrochemical facilities and ethylene oxide processes. Due to schedule and resource constraints, data on CO2 sequestration have not been compiled and need to be reviewed to better understand available data to estimate the fate of these captured emissions. Any CO2 potentially captured from petrochemical facilities is currently assumed to be released.  ",NE
2.C. Metal Industry,,,,
2.C.1.c,Iron and Steel Production: Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) Production,CH4,"Data on fuel consumption used in the production of DRI are not readily available to apply the IPCC default Tier 1 CH4 emission factor. However, an assumed emission factor can be developed based on the default energy consumption of 12.5 GJ natural gas per metric ton of DRI produced. Based on this assumption and annual DRI production in metric tons results in CH4 emissions of 0.74 kt CO2. Eq.",0.74
2.E Electronics Industry,,,,
2.E.2,Fluorinated Gas Emissions from Electronics Industry: TFT Flat Panel Displays,"HFCs, PFCs,","In addition to requiring reporting of emissions from semiconductor manufacturing, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMs), and photovoltaic cells, EPA’s GHGRP requires the reporting of emissions from the manufacture of flat panel displays. However, no flat panel displays manufacturing facilities have ever reported to EPA’s GHGRP, indicating that there are no facilities in the United States that have exceeded the GHGRP’s applicability threshold for display manufacturers since 2010. The available information on this sector indicates that these emissions are well below the significance threshold.[6] Per this published literature, the United States has never been significant display manufacturer aside from a small amount of manufacturing in the 1990s, but not mass production.",NE

2.G Other,,,,
2.G.2,Other Product Manufacture and Use: SF6 and PFCs from Other Product Use,SF6 ,"Emissions of SF6 occur from particle accelerators and military applications, and emissions of PFCs and other F-GHGs occur from military applications such as use of fluorinated heat transfer fluids (HTFs). Emissions from some particle accelerators and from military applications are reported by the U.S. government to the Federal Energy Management Program along with emissions of other fluorinated greenhouse gases (e.g., HFCs from mobile and stationary air conditioning) under the categories “Fugitive Fluorinated Gases and Other Fugitive Emissions” and “Industrial Process Emissions.” Analysis of the underlying data for 2018 indicated “fugitive” emissions of SF6 of approximately 600 kt CO2 Eq. from the U.S. government as a whole, and “process” emissions of SF6 of approximately 100 kt CO2 Eq. (Emissions of SF6 that are known to be accounted for elsewhere, such as under Electrical Transmission and Distribution, have been excluded from these totals.) The sources of the “fugitive” emissions of SF6 were not identified, but the source of the vast majority of “process” emissions of SF6 was particle accelerators. ",700
,,,"Note, fugitive emissions of approximately 200 kt CO2 Eq. of compounds that are commonly used as fluorinated HTFs (HFEs and fully fluorinated compounds, likely perfluoroamines, perfluoromorpholines, and/or PFPMIEs) were also reported. Per paragraph 33 of the UN reporting guidelines, such “additional GHGs” should be reported separately from national totals so are not considered in estimate of 2019 emissions. EPA plans to contact reporting agencies to better understand the sources of the emissions and the estimation methods used by reporters, which may equate emissions to consumption and therefore over- or underestimate some emissions, depending on the circumstances. This step will help EPA improve its assessment of significance and prioritize incorporating estimates in future Inventory submissions. ",
