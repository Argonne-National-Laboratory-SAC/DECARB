"Note: For most activity sources data were not available after 2015 and emissions were estimated with a data splicing method. Additional activity data will be collected and the Tier 1, 2 and 3 methods will be applied in a future inventory to recalculate the part of the time series that is estimated with the data splicing methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
