a GWP values used in this report are calculated over 100-year time horizon.,,,,
"b For a given amount of CO2 emitted, some fraction of the atmospheric increase in concentration is quickly absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial vegetation, some fraction of the atmospheric increase will only slowly decrease over a number of years, and a small portion of the increase will remain for many centuries or more.",,,,
c The methane GWP includes the direct effects and those indirect effects due to the production of tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor. The indirect effect due to the production of CO2 is not included.,,,,
"d Methane and N2O have chemical feedback systems that can alter the length of the atmospheric response, in these cases, global mean atmospheric lifetime (LT) is given first, followed by perturbation time (PT), but only the perturbation time is listed here and not the atmospheric residence time.",,,,
e See Table A-1 of FR 40 CFR Part 98.,,,,
