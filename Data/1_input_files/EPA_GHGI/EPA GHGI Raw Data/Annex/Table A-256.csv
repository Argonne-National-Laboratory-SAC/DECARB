General Assessment Factor,Definition,How the Factor was Considered
Soundness (AF1),"The extent to which the scientific and technical procedures, measures, methods or models employed to generate the information are reasonable for, and consistent with their intended application. ","The underlying data, methodologies, and models used to generate the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks are reasonable for and consistent with their intended application, to provide information regarding all sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the United States for the Inventory year, as required per UNFCCC Annex I country reporting requirements.

The U.S. emissions calculations follow the 2006 IPCC Guidelines developed specifically for UNFCCC inventory reporting. They are based on the best available, peer-reviewed scientific information, and have been used by the international community for over 25 years. When possible, Tier 2 and Tier 3 methodologies from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines are applied to calculate U.S. emissions more accurately. "
Applicability and Utility (AF2),The extent to which the information is relevant for the Agency’s intended use.,"The Inventory’s underlying data, methodology, and models are relevant for their intended application because they generate the sector-specific greenhouse gas emissions trends necessary for assessing and understanding all sources and sinks of greenhouse gases in the United States for the Inventory year. They are relevant for communicating U.S. emissions information to domestic audiences, and they are consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines developed specifically for UNFCCC reporting purposes of international greenhouse gas inventories."
Clarity and Completeness (AF3),"The degree of clarity and completeness with which the data, assumptions, methods, quality assurance, sponsoring organizations and analyzes employed to generate the information are documented.","The methodological and calculation approaches applied to generate the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks are extensively documented in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The Inventory report describes its adherence to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, and the U.S. Government agencies provide data to implement the 2006 IPCC Guidelines approaches. Any changes made to calculations, due to updated data and methods, are explained and documented in the report consistent with UNFCCC reporting guidelines."
Uncertainty and Variability (AF4),"The extent to which the variability and uncertainty (quantitative and qualitative) in the information or in the procedures, measures, methods or models are evaluated and characterized.","The evaluation of uncertainties for underlying data is documented in the Annex 7 Uncertainty to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. In accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the uncertainty associated with the Inventory’s underlying input data was evaluated by running a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis on most source and/or category emissions data to produce a 95 percent confidence interval for the annual greenhouse gas emissions for that source and/or sink. The error propagation approach is used to quantify uncertainties for some categories that are not significant contributors to emissions across the time series. To develop overall uncertainty estimates, the Monte Carlo simulation output data for each emission source and/or sink category uncertainty analysis were combined by type of gas, and the probability distributions were fitted to the combined simulation output data where such simulated output data were available. "
Evaluation and Review (AF5),"The extent of independent verification, validation and peer review of the information or of the procedures, measures, methods or models.","The majority of the underlying methodology, calculations, and models used to generate the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks have been independently verified and peer reviewed as part of their publication in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the 2019 Refinement. In cases where the methodology differs slightly from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, these were independently verified and validated by technical experts during the annual expert review phase of the Inventory development process.

For the data used in calculating greenhouse gas emissions for each source, multiple levels of evaluation and review occur. Data are compared to results from previous years, and calculations and equations are continually evaluated and updated as appropriate. Throughout the process, inventory data and methodological improvements are planned and incorporated.

The Inventory undergoes annual cycles of expert and public review before publication. This process ensures that both experts and the general public can review each category of emissions and sinks and have an extended opportunity to provide feedback on the methodologies used, calculations, data sources, and presentation of information.
