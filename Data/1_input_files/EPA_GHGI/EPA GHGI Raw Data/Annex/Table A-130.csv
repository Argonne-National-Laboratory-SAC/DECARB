1 Transitions between the start year and date of full penetration in new equipment are assumed to be linear so that in total 100 percent of the market is assigned to the original ODS or the various ODS substitutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 The CFC-12 reciprocating chillers market for new systems transitioned to HCFC-22 overnight in 1993. This transition is not shown in the table in order to provide the HFC transitions in greater detail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 DX refers to direct expansion systems where the compressors are mounted together in a rack and share suction and discharge refrigeration lines that run throughout the store, feeding refrigerant to the display cases in the sales area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 DR refers to distributed refrigeration systems that consist of multiple smaller units that are located close to the display cases that they serve such as on the roof above the cases, behind a nearby wall, or on top of or next to the case in the sales area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 SLS refers to secondary loop systems wherein a secondary fluid such as glycol or carbon dioxide is cooled by the primary refrigerant in the machine room and then pumped throughout the store to remove heat from the display equipment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6 The CFC-12 large retail food market for new systems transitioned to R-502 from 1988 to 1990, and subsequently transitioned to HCFC-22 from 1990 to 1993. These transitions are not shown in the table in order to provide the HFC transitions in greater detail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
7 Growth Rate is the average annual growth rate for individual market sectors from the base year to 2030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
