"a In general, total emissions from foam end-uses are assumed to be 100 percent. In the Rigid PU Domestic Refrigerator and Freezer Insulation and PU and PIR Boardstock end-uses, the source of emission rates and lifetimes did not yield 100 percent emission; the remainder is anticipated to be emitted at a rate of 2.0 and 1.5 percent/year, respectively, post-disposal.",,,,,
