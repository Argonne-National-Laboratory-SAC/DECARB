"Note: In the current Inventory, NRI data only provide land use and management statistics through 2015. ",,,,,
Additional data will be incorporated in the future to extend the time series of the land use data.,,,,,

"[1] The current Inventory includes estimation of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from all privately-owned and federal grasslands and croplands in the conterminous United States and Hawaii, but does not include the croplands and grasslands in Alaska. This leads to a discrepancy between the total area in this table, which is included in the estimation, compared to the total managed land area in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base.  See Planned Improvement sections in Cropland Remaining Cropland, Land Converted to Cropland, Grassland Remaining Grassland and Land Converted to Grassland for more information about filling these gaps in the future so that emissions and removals will be estimated for all managed land.",,,,,
