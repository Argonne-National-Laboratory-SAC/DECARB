"a For some equipment, first-fill emissions are adjusted to account for equipment that are produced in the United States, including those which are produced for export, and excluding those that are imported pre-charged estimate. ",,,,
"b Disposal emissions rates are developed based on consideration of the original charge size, the percentage of refrigerant likely to remain in equipment at the time of disposal, and recovery practices assumed to vary by gas type. Because equipment lifetime emissions are annualized, equipment is assumed to reach the end of its lifetime with a full charge. Therefore, recovery rate is equal to 100 percent - Disposal Loss Rate (%).",,,,
