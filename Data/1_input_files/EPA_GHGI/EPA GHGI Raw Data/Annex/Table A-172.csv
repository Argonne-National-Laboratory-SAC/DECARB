"a In the methane inventory for manure management, the percent of dairy cows and swine with AD systems is estimated using data from EPA’s AgSTAR Program. Deep pit systems are their own manure management systems in the U.S. but are included under Liquid Systems in the UNFCCC CRF tables due to lack of a separate allocation for those systems within the tables.",,,,,,,,,,
"b Because manure from beef feedlots and dairy heifers may be managed for long periods of time in multiple systems (i.e., both drylot and runoff collection pond), the percent of manure that generates emissions is greater than 100 percent.",,,,,,,,,,
