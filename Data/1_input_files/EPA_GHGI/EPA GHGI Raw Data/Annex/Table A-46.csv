Note: “-“ Indicates no sample data available.,,,,
"a HGL is a blend of multiple paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons: ethane, propane, isobutane, and normal butane, each with their own heat content, density and C content, see Table A-40. ",,,,
"b Heat, density, and percent carbon values are provided separately for ethane, and isobutene, butane, ethylene, isobutylene, and butylene. ",,,,
c Parameters presented are for naphthas with a boiling temperature less than 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Petrochemical feedstocks with higher boiling points are assumed to have the same characteristics as distillate fuel.,,,,
d The miscellaneous products category reported by EIA is assumed to be mostly petroleum refinery sulfur compounds that do not contain carbon (EIA 2019).,,,,
