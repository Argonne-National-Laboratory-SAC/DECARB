"Note:  The method used to estimate CO2 emissions in this supplementary information table differs from the method used to estimate CO2 in the industrial and commercial sectors in the Inventory, which include CO2 emissions from all non-transportation mobile sources (see Section 3.1 for the methodology for estimating CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in this Inventory). The current Inventory uses the Nonroad component of MOVES2014b for years 1999 through 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
