"[1] Y=25, 000 MTCO2 Eq., or industry-specific threshold other than 25, 000 MTCO2 Eq.; N = all facilities in industry category must report regardless of annual emissions.  Information on industry-specific threshold and implications of the reporting threshold or lack of threshold in estimating national greenhouse gas emissions is discussed in the respective source category methodology sections.",,,,,,,,
"[2]  Consistent with IPCC good practices, QA/QC using GHGRP may not be appropriate if this is the primary data source for estimating emissions. Depending on use, other data sets may be more appropriate for QA/QC of Inventory estimates.",,,,,,,,
