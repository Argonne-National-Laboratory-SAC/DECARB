"a Distillate fuel oil No. 2 and residual fuel oil No. 6 are used in the CO2 from fossil fuel combustion calculations, and other oil types are presented for informational purposes only. An additional discussion on the derivation of these carbon content coefficients is presented in Annex 2.2.",
b These coefficients vary annually due to fluctuations in fuel quality (see Table A-28).,
