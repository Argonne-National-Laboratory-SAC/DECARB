,"a Estimate developed using a ‘per station’ weighted average EF (based on data from the GSI 2019 study, GHGRP wellhead component counts, and field type distributions from EIA) and the number of underground storage stations over the time series (already in the Inventory).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"b Estimate developed using PHMSA storage well counts and GSI emission factors. EPA has not developed an approach for the full time series for the activity data or emission factors, and is showing preliminary estimates for 2017 through 2019 emissions because those are the years where PHMSA storage well counts are available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"c The Current Estimate shows the routine storage well leak emissions only, to allow for a direct comparison, and does not include the Aliso Canyon leak emissions that occurred in 2015 and 2016 and that are included in the Inventory under the storage wells line item.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
