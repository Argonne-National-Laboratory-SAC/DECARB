"Notes: In 2011, FHWA changed its methods for estimating vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and related data. These methodological changes included how vehicles are classified, moving from a system based on body type to one that is based on wheelbase. These changes were first incorporated for the 1990 through 2010 Inventory and apply to the 2007 through 2019 time period. This resulted in large changes in VMT and fuel consumption data by vehicle class, thus leading to a shift in emissions among on-road vehicle classes. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a See Annex 3.2 for definitions of on-road vehicle types. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle mileage estimates are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table VM-1. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c Rail emissions do not include emissions from electric powered locomotives. Class II and Class III diesel consumption data for 2014 to 2017 is estimated by applying the historical average fuel usage per carload factor to the annual number of carloads. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Includes equipment, such as tractors and combines, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road in agriculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e Includes equipment, such as cranes, dumpers, and excavators, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road in construction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f “Other” includes snowmobiles and other recreational equipment, logging equipment, lawn and garden equipment, railroad equipment, airport equipment, commercial equipment, and industrial equipment, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road for commercial/industrial purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
