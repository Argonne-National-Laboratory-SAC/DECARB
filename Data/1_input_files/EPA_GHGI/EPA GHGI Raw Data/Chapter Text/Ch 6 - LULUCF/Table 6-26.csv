Notes: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Parentheses indicate net uptake. It is not possible to separate emissions from drained organic soils between Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land so estimates for organic soils are included in Table 6-8 and Table 6-9 of the Forest Land Remaining Forest Land section of the Inventory.  ,,,,,
