a This table includes estimates from Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Estimates of C and CO2 emissions from drained organic soils are described in this section but reported in Table 6-8 and Table 6-9 for both Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land in order to allow for reporting of all C stock changes on forest lands in a complete and comprehensive manner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
