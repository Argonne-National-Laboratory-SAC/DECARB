Note: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.,,,,
"a These emissions have already been included in the estimates of net annual changes in C stocks, which include the amount sequestered minus any emissions, including the assumption that combusted wood may continue to decay through time.",,,,
"b Some fire data for 2018 and all of 2019 were unavailable when these estimates were summarized; therefore 2017 or 2018, the most recent available estimate, is applied to 2019.",,,,
