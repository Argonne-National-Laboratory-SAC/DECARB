,"a These estimates include C stock changes from drained organic soils from both Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land. See the section below on CO2, CH4, and N2O Emissions from Drained Organic Soils for the methodology used to estimate the CO2 emissions from drained organic soils. Also, Table 6?20 and Table 6?21 for non-CO2 emissions from drainage of organic soils from both Forest Land Remaining Forest Land and Land Converted to Forest Land.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Notes: Forest ecosystem C stock changes do not include forest stocks in U.S. Territories because managed forest land for U.S. Territories is not currently included in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base. The forest ecosystem C stock changes do not include Hawaii because there is not sufficient NFI data to support inclusion at this time. However, managed forest land area for Hawaii is included in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base so there are small differences in the forest land area estimates in this Section and Section 6.1. See Annex 3.13, Table A-214 for annual differences between the forest area reported in Section 6.1 Representation of the U.S. Land Base and Section 6.2 Forest Land Remaining Forest Land. The forest ecosystem C stock changes do not include trees on non-forest land (e.g., agroforestry systems and settlement areas—see Section 6.10 Settlements Remaining Settlements for estimates of C stock change from settlement trees). Forest ecosystem C stocks on managed forest land in Alaska were compiled using the gain-loss method as described in Annex 3.13. Parentheses indicate net C uptake (i.e., a net removal of C from the atmosphere). Total net flux is an estimate of the actual net flux between the total forest C pool and the atmosphere. Harvested wood estimates are based on results from annual surveys and models. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
