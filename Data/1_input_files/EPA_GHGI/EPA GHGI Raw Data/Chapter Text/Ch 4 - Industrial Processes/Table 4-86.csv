,"a Weighted average includes all die casters, Partners and non-Partners. For the majority of the time series (2000 through 2010), Partners made up 100 percent of die casters in the United States.",,,,
,b Weighted average that includes an estimated emission factor of 5.2 kg SF6 per metric ton of magnesium for die casters that do not participate in the Partnership.,,,,
