"(a) Others represent an unspecified mix of HFCs and PFCs, which includes HFC-152a, HFC-227ea, HFC-245fa, HFC-365mfc, HFC-43-10mee, HCFO-1233zd(E), HFO-1234yf, HFO-1234ze(E), HFO-1336mzz(Z), C4F10, and PFC/PFPEs, the latter being a proxy for a diverse collection of PFCs and perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) employed for solvent applications. For estimating purposes, the GWP value used for PFC/PFPEs was based upon C6F14.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
