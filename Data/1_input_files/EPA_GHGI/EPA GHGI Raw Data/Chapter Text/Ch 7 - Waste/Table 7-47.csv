,"1 The amount of waste digested primarily consists of food waste. The amount processed for all years is likely an underestimate because the estimates were developed from survey data provided by operating facilities for 2015 and 2016 (EPA 2018;  EPA 2019). Facilities that did not respond to the EPA surveys are not included and all years except 2015 and 2016 are estimated using assumptions regarding the number of operating facilities and the weighted average of waste digested. Additionally, the liquid portion of the waste digested in 2015 and 2016 are not included due to limited information on the specific waste types to perform the unit conversion to kt. The average waste digested as reported in EPA 2018 and 2019 is used as a proxy for years 2017 to 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
