1 Total biogas produced in standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) was reported in aggregate in the EPA survey data (EPA 2018 and 2019) for 2015 and 2016. The quantities presented in this table are likely underestimates because not all operational facilities provided a survey response to the EPA AD Data Collection Surveys. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Data for all years in the time series except for 2015 and 2016 are extrapolated using the average of the total biogas collected in 2015 and 2016, divided by the average number of survey responses to generate an average estimate of biogas collected per facility, which is then multiplied by the total facility count (as shown in Table 7-30).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 The quantity of CH4 recovered from the biogas produced is estimated for all years except 2015 and 2016, which are taken from EPA (2018) and (2019). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
