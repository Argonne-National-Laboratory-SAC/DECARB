,a MSW CH4 generation is not estimated after 2005 because the directly reported net CH4 emissions from the GHGRP are used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,b Methane recovery is not calculated for industrial landfills because this is not a common practice in the United States. Only 1 landfill of 169 that report to Subpart TT (Industrial Waste Landfills) of the GHGRP had an active gas collection and control system during the year 2019 (EPA 2020b).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,“-” Not applicable due to methodology change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Notes: Totals may not sum due to independent rounding. Parentheses indicate negative values. For years 1990 to 2004, the Inventory methodology for MSW landfills uses the first order decay methodology. A methodological change occurs in year 2005. For years 2005 to 2019, directly reported net CH4 emissions from the GHGRP data plus a scale-up factor are used to account for emissions from landfill facilities that are not subject to the GHGRP. These data incorporate CH4 recovered and oxidized for MSW landfills. As such, CH4 generation and CH4 recovery are not calculated separately. See the Time-Series Consistency section of this chapter for more information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
