"1 The count of operational facilities was visually estimated from Figure 5 in EPA 2020, which presents the count of the first year of digester operation. The number of operational facilities by year is assumed to be the cumulative total from the prior year. This method assumes all facilities are operating from 1990, or their first year of operation, to 2019. This is further discussed in the Uncertainty and Time Series section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
