LULUCF emissions include the CH4, and N2O emissions from Peatlands Remaining Peatlands; CH4 and N2O emissions reported for Non-CO2 Emissions from Forest Fires, Non-CO2 Emissions from Grassland Fires, and Coastal Wetlands Remaining Coastal Wetlands; CH4 emissions from Land Converted to Coastal Wetlands; and N2O emissions from Forest Soils and Settlement Soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
